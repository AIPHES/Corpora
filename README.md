##Description
This resource is a manually created heterogenous multi-document summarization corpus, using source texts from the [DBS](http://www.bildungsserver.de). 

It consists of several parts, namely the list of the source links, the final coherent summaries, the automatic summaries, the intermediate steps such as the extracted nuggets, and the best nuggets out of these.
